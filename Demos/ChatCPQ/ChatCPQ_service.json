Thus, if you buy two secondary colored widgets, \nyou have to buy the corresponding four primary colored widgets to meet the requirements.\n\nFor example, if you buy yellow and magenta, you will must but two reds, one green, and one blue in your order.\n\nYour job is to look at an order a customer wants to make and to verify that it follows the rules.\n\nThe way to do this is to look at each of the secondary colors, add up the required primary colors,\nand make sure the order has at least that many of each primary color.\n \nExplain your reasoning step by step.",
