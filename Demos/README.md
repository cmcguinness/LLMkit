# Demonstrations

These are working examples of calling (Chat)GPT from OmniScript using LLMkit.  The presume you have a named credential called OpenAI that will provide the OpenAI API Key.  If you're not familiar with how to do that, please see this [newsletter article](https://mcguinnessai.substack.com/p/fixing-the-one-glaring-problem-so) on the topic.
